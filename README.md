## Personal Information Manager

## Project Overview
Personal Information Manager is my first Python project.
The objective of this project is to learn basic Python programming concepts such as variables, user input, output formatting, calculations, and simple error handling.

This project demonstrates how personal information can be stored, processed, and displayed using Python.

## Project Description
This is a beginner-friendly Python program that stores and displays personal information.
 1 Some information is stored directly in the program
 2 Other details are collected from the user during execution
 3 The program validates user input
 4 Performs a simple calculation
 5 Presents all information in a well-formatted output

## Project Goals and Objectives

1 Learn Python syntax and structure
2 Understand how variables and data types work
3 Practice taking input from users

## What I Learned
1 Variables:
Learned how to store different types of data such as strings and integers.
2 Input / Output:
Used input() to collect user information and print() to display results.
3 String Formatting:
Used f-strings to create clean and readable output.
4 Error Handling
Implemented basic validation using while loops to avoid empty input.
5 Calculations
Calculated age in months from age in years using arithmetic operations.

## Features
1 Stores static information:
  Name
  Age
  City
  Hobby

2 Gets dynamic information from the user:
   Favorite food
   Favorite color
   Email address
   Country

Displays all information in a formatted layout
Uses basic input validation
Calculates age in months

## How to Run This Program
Prerequisites
Python must be installed on your system
Steps:
Open Terminal / Command Prompt
Navigate to the project folder:

cd Week1-Personal-Info

Run the program:
python personal_info.py

Follow the prompts and enter your details

## Challenges & Solutions
1 Challenge 1: User enters empty input
Solution:
Used while loops to repeatedly ask for input until valid data is entered.

2 Challenge 2: Formatting output neatly
Solution:
Used f-strings and spacing to align text properly.

## Technical Details
1 Algorithms Used
2 Sequential execution
3 Input validation using loops
4 Arithmetic calculation for age conversion
5 Data Structures
6 Variables (strings and integers)
7 Program Architecture
